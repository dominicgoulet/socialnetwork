Welcome to Ninetyfour !

Your user account identity is never revealed to anyone.

In order to use Ninetyfour, you will have to either create a person profile or identify yourself as a brand.
Don't worry, you can have multiple profiles and brands.

Let's say Mark Hamill signs up to Ninetyour (we won't tell you if he does).

Mark (sounds like we are close friends, I wish) will be able to create muliple profiles:
- Mark Hamill
- Luke Skywalker
- The Jedis

Mark and Luke will be able to act as people, while The Jedis will be a brand page.
They might even share a joke about The Empire (another brand) if they wised to.

Where do you want to start?

or
<%= link_to '[ Create a Brand profile ]', new_brand_path %>
