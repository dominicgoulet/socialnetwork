Ninetyfour is a very different social network.
There are no ads, and our TrueReach‚Ñ¢Ô∏è algorithm ensures that your content is not behind a pay-per-view model.
In our commitment to be green, we leave a very minimal digital footprint. Every piece of content is permanently deleted after 30 days.
As we are not in the business of selling ads, we do not collect any information about you whatsoever.
We do not track your habits, what you do on the platform and are not interested in your personal life.
There are no bots or outside applications that can access Ninetyfour, so your content is only to be viewed by actual humans.

You can now explore Ninetyfour.

Wonder how we make a living?
Easy. Brands have a monthly fee once they reach 100 followers.
Don't worry, the monthly fee is way below what you would spend on ads on whatever platform you were using.
